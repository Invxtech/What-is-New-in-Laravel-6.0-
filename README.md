Laravel 6.0 New Features:

Laravel 6.0 Is the New LTS:
The release of Laravel 6.0 marks the new LTS version of Laravel, with bugfixes until September 3rd, 2021 and security fixes until September 3rd, 2022. Laravel 5.5 was the previous LTS (with security fixes until August 30th, 2020). 
Hereâ€™s the updated table with versions and dates of the latest versions of Laravel:

Semantic Versioning:
The Laravel release notes clarify semantic versioning going forward in Laravel 6.0 and beyond:
The Laravel framework (laravel/framework) package now follows the semantic versioning standard. This makes the framework consistent with the other first-party Laravel packages which already followed this versioning standard. The Laravel release cycle will remain unchanged.
Improved Exceptions Via Ignition:
Laravel 6 ships with Ignition, a new open source exception detail page created by Freek Van der Herten and Marcel Pociot. Ignition offers many benefits over previous releases, such as improved Blade error file and line number handling, runnable solutions for common problems, code editing, exception sharing, and an improved UX.

Laravel Vapor Compatibility
Laravel Vapor was built by Taylor Otwell.

Laravel 6 provides compatibility with Laravel Vapor, an auto-scaling serverless deployment platform for Laravel. Vapor abstracts the complexity of managing Laravel applications on AWS Lambda, as well as interfacing those applications with SQS queues, databases, Redis clusters, networks, CloudFront CDN, and more.
